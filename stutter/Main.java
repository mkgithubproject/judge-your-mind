/*Write a method stutter that doubles the size of a list by replacing every integer in the list with two of that integer. For example, suppose a variable list stores the following sequence of integers:

[1, 8, 19, 4, 17]
After a call of list.stutter(), it should store the following sequence of integers:

[1, 1, 8, 8, 19, 19, 4, 4, 17, 17]
Assume that you are adding this method to the LinkedIntList class as defined below:

public class LinkedIntList {
    private ListNode front;   // null for an empty list
    ...
}*/
public void stutter(){
    ListNode current= front;
    stutter(current);

 }
private void stutter(ListNode current){
     if(current!=null){
         current.next=new ListNode(current.data,current.next);
         stutter(current.next.next);
     }
}
